_This post is part of my project to post every day in October - it is consequently very rough and needs editing._

- It is worth explaining how I develop ideas and how I get things done.
- I do not explain my system because it is perfect, but because it is imperfect. 
- The goal of this post is threefold: to reflect on my own system, to gather feedback from others, and to serve as a useful reference point for those building their own systems.
- Before I elaborate further it is worth reflecting on the privileges I have that enable this system.
    - I have the time and mental space to reflect on my systems and improve them.
    - I have supportive and healthy relationships which reenergize me.
    - I am able to work from a spacious home during the Covid-19 era.
    - I have access to stable infrastructure.
- Here is what I do empirically:
    - Physical Infrastructure:
        - I have a small home office outside of my bedroom which I primarily work from.
        - This enables a mental separation between work and leisure spaces.
        - In this space I have a large freestanding whiteboard.
        - This has proven invaluable for writing reminders, for presentations, and for making rough diagrams.
        - I have a number of lighting sources to ensure high quality light at all times of day.
    - Digital Systems:
        - Sometimes I use RescueTime to understand when and why I allocate time to different activities.
        - Sometimes I use Tablimiter to reduce the number of websites that I can have open simultaneously. I currently have this set to 4 webpages.
        - Sometimes I journal using Roam. I will use Roam both for personal notes and large scale project planning.
        - I use Todoist to keep track of things that I need to do as well as their rough priority.
    - Wellbeing:
        - I generally prioritize sleep over most other things including socialization, exercise and work.
        - I sleep on the ground in my room.
        - I do a low to moderate amount of exercise on most days, which in practice means either using freeweight dumbells at home or running to and from a pullup bar less than a mile from my home.
        - I generally tend towards a diet which leans towards low processed sugar and higher protein and fat.
        - I regularly speak to my family members, and on average I speak to one family member every two days.
        - I live in a house with four other people, with whom I generally cook and eat dinner. I have lived in this house for three years, and the group of people has largely remained consistent.
        - My girlfriend lives a short walk away.
- These are the systems which I have experimented with, and which I am not adhering to right now, but which I plan to resume with some modification or automation.
    - I have used google calendar to record both my plan for using a block of time as well as what I actually used that time for.
    - I have used google calendar to record my energy on a scale from 1-5 at each hour in the day.
    - I have scheduled a self-check-in every 3 hours to evaluate how I am feeling and whether I am doing the right thing.
    - I have built a large spreadsheet with one row per day, containing columns for overall happiness on a scale from 1-10, as well as columns for diet, for exercise, for productivity, and for relationships.
- These are systems which I plan to evaluate next:
    - Ultraworking.
    - Beeminder.
    - Making Public commitments on Twitter and Facebook.
- These are the abstract instrumental goals which the systems are meant to achieve:
    - Monotasking
    - Emergent Ontologies
    - Emergent Schedule
    - Energy Management
    - Motivation Management
    - Goal-Content-Integrity

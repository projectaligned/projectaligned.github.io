@ [Harvard](https://kirkland.harvard.edu/home) Graduated 2017:
=====
I earned an undergraduate degree in physics at Harvard, where I researched [Topological Insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_insulator) with the [Yacoby Group](http://yacoby.physics.harvard.edu/) resulting in [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085151). I did further research with at the [Center for Quantum Devices](https://qdev.nbi.ku.dk/research/topological_quantum_systems/) in Copenhagen to find signals of [Majorana Fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion) as part of the goal to build a [Topological Quantum Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer). 

@ [Rigetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing) 2017-2019:
=====
After my undergraduate research experiences, I joined [Rigetti Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing) to build a functioning quantum computer and bring it to market. I began by working on the Applications Engineering team, focused on understanding the limitations and applications of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ([QAOA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028)), culminating in a [conference talk](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR18/Session/R15.7) and contribution towards a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05771). After a year, I recognized that the relative lack of progress in quantum hardware limited quantum algorithms research. I moved to the Quantum Software Team to develop internal tools to accelerate hardware progress. Improving the stability of the quantum computer stood out to me as particularly important. Therefore I focused on understanding the [defects](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/understanding-performance-fluctuations.html) the undermined that stability. To detect these defects, I built tools for [online changepoint detection](https://pypi.org/project/chchanges/#history) and statistical model selection to automatically process the vast amount of data generated by our experiments.

@ [Sisu](https://sisudata.com/) 2019-Present:
=====
My experiences with large-scale data analysis of experimental data at Rigetti catalyzed an interest in joining an organization focused on data analytics. So I moved to [Sisu Data](https://sisudata.com/). As part of the Product Engineering team there, I built the user-facing side of the platform and deepened my understanding of how people use machine learning to solve business problems. After a few months at Rigetti, I began thinking more deeply about what we choose to optimize and why.

@ Present:
=====
My goal is to build a system that automatically and accurately infers emotional states and uses the resulting time-series data in conjunction with other behavioral data to recommend actions for people to achieve their psychological goals. Achieving this goal requires taking years of [Affective Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing) research and packaging it as a product. I call this "Project Aligned."

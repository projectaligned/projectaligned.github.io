@ [Harvard](https://kirkland.harvard.edu/home) Graduated 2017:
=====
I earned an undergraduate degree in physics at Harvard, where I did research on [Topological Insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_insulator) with the [Yacoby Group](http://yacoby.physics.harvard.edu/) resulting in [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085151). I did further research with at the [Center for Quantum Devices](https://qdev.nbi.ku.dk/research/topological_quantum_systems/) in Copenhagen in an effort to find signals of [Majorana Fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion) as part of the goal to build a [Topological Quantum Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer). 

@ [Rigetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing) 2017-2019:
=====
After my undergraduate research experiences I joined [Rigetti Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing) in an effort to build a functioning quantum computer and bring it to market. I began by working on the Applications Engineering team, focused on understanding the limitations and applications of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ([QAOA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028)), culminating in a [conference talk](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR18/Session/R15.7) and contribution towards a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05771). After a year I recognized that quantum algorithms research was significantly bottlenecked by progress in quantum hardware, and I moved to the Quantum Software Team to develop internal tools to accelerate hardware progress. Improving the [stability](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/understanding-performance-fluctuations.html) of the quantum computer stood out to me as particularly important, so I focused on understanding the defects the undermined that stability. In order to detect these defects I built tools for [online changepoint detection](https://pypi.org/project/chchanges/#history) and statistical model selection in order to automatically process the vast amount of data generated by our experiments.

@ [Sisu](https://sisudata.com/) 2019-Present:
=====
My experiences with large-scale data analysis of experimental data at Rigetti catalyzed an interest in joining an organization focused on machine learning and data analytics in order to further develop these skillsets. So I moved to [Sisu Data](https://sisudata.com/) where, as part of the Product Engineering team, I've built the user facing side of the platform and deepened my understanding of how people use machine learning to solve business problems. After a few months at Rigetti, I began thinking more deeply about what we choose to optimize and why.

@ Present:
=====
My goal is to build a system that automatically and accurate infers emotional states and uses the resulting time series data in conjunction with other behavioral data to recommend actions for people to take so that they can achieve their psychological goals. This requires taking years of [Affective Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing) research and packaging it a product that is widely accessible to the public. I am calling this effort "Project Aligned", start [here](https://github.com/projectaligned/outline) if you wish to learn more.

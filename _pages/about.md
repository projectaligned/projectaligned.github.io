My goal is to build a system that automatically and accurately infers emotional states and uses the resulting time-series data in conjunction with other behavioral data to recommend actions for people to achieve their psychological goals. Achieving this goal requires taking years of [Affective Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing) research and packaging it as a product. I call this "Project Aligned."

@ [Sisu](https://sisudata.com/) 2019-Present:

My experiences with large-scale data analysis of experimental data at Rigetti catalyzed an interest in joining an organization focused on data analytics. So I moved to [Sisu Data](https://sisudata.com/). As part of the Product Engineering team there, I built the user-facing side of the platform and deepened my understanding of how people use machine learning to solve business problems. After a few months at Rigetti, I began thinking more deeply about what we choose to optimize and why.

I joined [Rigetti Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing) to build a useful quantum computer. I started by working on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ([QAOA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028)), culminating in a [conference talk](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR18/Session/R15.7) and a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05771). After a year, I recognized that hardware limitations bottlenecked algorithms research. I then started developing software tools to improve hardware fabrication and reduce [defects](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/08/understanding-performance-fluctuations.html). I built tools for [online changepoint detection](https://pypi.org/project/chchanges/#history) and statistical model selection to automatically detect these defects.

@ [Harvard](https://kirkland.harvard.edu/home) Graduated 2017:
-----
I earned a BA in physics at Harvard, where I studied [Topological Insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_insulator) with the [Yacoby Group](http://yacoby.physics.harvard.edu/) resulting in [publication](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085151). I also worked at the [Center for Quantum Devices](https://qdev.nbi.ku.dk/research/topological_quantum_systems/) looking for [Majorana Fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion) in order to build a [Topological Quantum Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer).
